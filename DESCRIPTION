This directory holds Xinu sources for the Beaglebone Black.

The instructions for booting on a BeagleBone Black can be found at:

	https://github.com/jarrocha/XinuBBB/tree/main

However, they do not work on all versions of the board because some versions of
uboot require bootm to specify the same memory location as specified to "fatload".
You may see the following error output:

    Running uenvcmd ...
    reading xinu.boot
    98368 bytes read in 10 ms (9.4 MiB/s)
    Wrong Image Format for bootm command
    ERROR: can't get kernel image!

To solve the problem, substitute the following uEnv.txt file and boot the binary
file "xinu" (no extension).

    bootfile=xinu
    memloc=0x81000000
    boot_mmc=fatload mmc 0 ${memloc} ${bootfile}; bootm ${memloc}
    uenvcmd=run boot_mmc

Thanks to Nick Daly for identifying the problem and finding a solution.
